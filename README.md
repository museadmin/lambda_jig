# Lambda Jig

---

## Description

Lambda jig, as it is, is a simple development environment for creating 
AWS lambdas. It can be used to enhance any IDE being used to develop in 
any of the supported languages for lambdas.

The linked Kepler blog post gives detailed information on installation 
and usage. The example lambda and integration notes are based on the 
Jetbrains IDE's Pycharm and IntelliJ. 

the principal benefits are:

* Supports local development, i.e. debugging within the IDE
* Deploys to AWS
* Updates the code on AWS 
* Deletes the lambda from AWS
* Can be used to support development in any language and IDE
